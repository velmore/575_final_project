The largest national wildlife refuge in the United States,  it is home to a wide variety of species, such as polar bears, caribou, wolves, and migratory birds. Birds migrate from across the United States and from six continents in order to feed and reproduce in the Arctic Refuge, taking advantage of the burst of plant and insect life during the long days of the Arctic summer.\n\nAlthough it was closed to oil drilling by an act of Congress in 1980, after months of negotiations�and vigorous opposition by Audubon and our partner conservation groups� President Trump has signed a tax bill into law that includes a provision that opens the ANWR to oil and gas drilling to offset massive corporate tax cuts. As dispiriting and offensive as this action is, we can still save the Arctic Refuge. A number of regulatory, scientific, political, financial, and infrastructure-related hurdles stand in the way of new leases, giving us opportunities to resist and reverse Congress� bad policy decision."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-144.2577504,68.62492423]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"altitude":"","geometry":"Point","id":2,"chapter":"2.

The proposed Pebble Mine would be one of the world�s largest open-pit gold mines. The project would dig a 1-mile wide, 1-mile long, and 200m deep mining pit in the heart of spawning salmon and breeding bird habitat, destroying 3,500 acres of wetlands, lakes, and ponds, and over 80 miles of salmon streams.\n\nAudubon Alaska with conservation partners, Alaska Native communities, the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, commercial and sport fishermen, subsistence hunters, and concerned citizens have said �No Pebble Mine� to Alaska legislators and the Pebble Limited Partnership.

Despite its name, the NPRA is an area of incredible birds and wildlife, in addition to the subsurface petroleum reserves. The Western Arctic's coastal plain is one of the largest wetland complexes in the circumpolar Arctic, attracting globally significant abundance of waterfowl, shore�birds, and raptors, and earning the name �America�s Bird Basket�. Birds from the Western Arctic disperse along all four major flyways of the United States, as well as to Asia and beyond. Teshekpuk Lake, a giant lake in the northeast corner of the Reserve, is a globally significant area for migratory birds.\n\nAfter recent oil discoveries and an order from the Trump administration's Department of Interior, however, many companies are pushing for more parts of the NPR-A to be opened to oil and gas leasing. Audubon and its partners are keeping a close eye on the areas being considered for development in order to safeguard that natural treasures of the NPR-A.

In combination with British Columbia�s Great Bear Rainforest immediately to the south, it encompasses the largest intact temperate rainforest on earth. The Tongass supports abundant fish and wildlife, including all five species of Pacific salmon, brown (grizzly) bears, wolves, Sitka black-tailed deer, Bald Eagles, Northern Goshawks, and Marbled Murrelets.\n\nLogging over the last century, however, has changed the Tongass, particularly by targeting the rare, old-growth forest stands with the biggest trees. To-date, perhaps half of the Tongass' big-tree old growth has been cut. Yet these same, productive stands are also the most important for fish, wildlife, and ecosystem integrity. Moreover, the Trump administration plans to exempt regions of the Tongass from the 2001 Roadless Rule. Roadless areas are home to salmon, grouse, goshawks, bears, wolves, and many other birds and wildlife, and they provide humans with opportunities for fishing, hunting, bird-watching, backpacking, and wilderness solitude. \n\nThe Tongass National Forest provides us with the greatest opportunity in the nation, if not the world, for protecting temperate rainforest at the ecosystem scale. But this opportunity will require a new, balanced approach for conserving the most important places in the forest while also providing sustainable economic opportunities for local communities."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-134.4511718,57.71423708]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"altitude":"","geometry":"Point","id":9,"chapter":"9.

The refuge supports one of the largest aggregations of water birds in the world, and the coastal region along the Bering Sea is unquestionably the most productive goose nesting habitat in North America, supporting an estimated half a million geese annually. The refuge also hosts approximately 80% of the continental breeding population of black brant, nearly all emperor geese, and one-third of the continent's northern pintails. In terms of both density and species diversity, the delta is the most important shorebird nesting area in the country, and the vast intertidal zone is the most important wetland for post-breeding shorebirds on the west coast of North America. In addition to waterbirds, the Kisaralik River is among the most important areas on the refuge for nesting raptors, and supports one of the densest breeding populations of breeding golden eagles in North America."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-163.2538723,61.32595138]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"altitude":"","geometry":"Point","id":10,"chapter":"10.

At the center, the narrow 53-mile-wide Bering Strait is the only waterway connecting the Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Major currents and sea ice fuel extremely high plankton and sea floor productivity which attracts more than 10 million nesting seabirds such as Least and Parakeet Auklets, as well as the global population of wintering Spectacled Eiders. Because the Strait is the only passage between the Pacific and Arctic Oceans, all wildlife that live in the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in the summer months funnel through the Bering Strait twice each year during spring and fall migration.\n\nAny environmental damage to the strait (such as a tanker spill) could have great impacts. In July 2018, Audubon Alaska received a formal commendation from the U.S. Coast Guard for our work on a Bering Strait ship routing study which resulted in international recognition and protection for areas that Audubon identified as crucial for birds and marine mammals in the region."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-175.657889,58.253027]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"altitude":"","geometry":"Point","id":11,"chapter":"11.

Its vast, shallow sea floor and seasonal ice cover provide nutrients and pristine habitat for a multitude of organisms, ranging from walruses to ice seals to whales to millions of seabirds to the top predator mammal, the polar bear. At least 15 species on Audubon's Alaska WatchList use the Chukchi, and it comprises nearly 20 globally and continentally importat Important Bird Areas (IBAs), including a dozen on the US side and six more on the Russian side. \n\nBut the Chukchi Sea is changing dramatically. The evidence of global climate change is evident here perhaps like no other place on earth. Sea temperatures are rising, shorelines are dramatically eroding, and summer sea ice is receding to historic lows. As sea ice retreats, there are substantial prospects for new industrial activities in the Chukchi, including commercial fishing, commercial shipping, and oil and gas extraction.\n"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-171.7715683,69.3919433]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"altitude":"","geometry":"Point","id":12,"chapter":"12.
