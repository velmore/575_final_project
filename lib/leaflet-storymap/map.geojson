One of the largest cities to do so was New Orleans. The city has removed 4 monuments as of August 2018, and the removal of the P.G.T.

Many suggestions about how to deal with confederate monuments have been made, such as providing context to the monuments while leaving them in place. Some say that monuments should be removed and perhaps placed in museums such as this one - the National Civil War Museum in Harrisburg, PA.
